//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//==> BFS (solution is not far from the root)

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
//==> BFS (DFS will take long + solutions are rare ==> DFS will take even longer)

//If the tree is very wide:
//==> DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//==> DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//==> DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
//==> BFS
